-------------------------------------------------------

List of features yet to be implemented:
    * add other commonly used server data to the services.xconfig file
      (livestream, etc), need to find out their server details
    * Option to output to mp4/avi file.  Not going to use ffmpeg by
      the way.  Just no way I'm going to use that thing.  I'll write
      it myself
    * add advanced settings for things like encoding and such
    * add video settings to allow gamma/brightness/contrast adjustment

-------------------------------------------------------

Things that need fixing:
    * improve error handling and reduce CrashError usage if possible
    * in relation to previous item, take initialization stuff out of
      the constructors
    * add in more speaker configuration support
    * possibly split up OBS.cpp, not entirely decided on it yet

-------------------------------------------------------

Things that could use more optimization:
    * multi-speaker downmixing

-------------------------------------------------------

Things that need more testing:
    * need to test streaming on networks other than twitch
