Notable super awesome testers:
  Kyle "Kendobear" Asher - A guy who spent weeks helping pinpoint a bug
                           specific to his system.  This guy deserves a
                           medal for his patience.

  D2Ultima/Frostshocker/Modnite - These guys helped me test the major network
                                  code updates, as well as helped point out
                                  compatibility issues for certain systems.
                                  The greatly improved network code would not
                                  have been possible without their help.
